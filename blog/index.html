What I think makes this uniquely achievable for Crank is that its component model is built on top of JavaScript’s two main control flow abstractions, iterators and promises, allowing developers to write components exclusively with sync and async functions and generator functions.</p>
<p>The following is an attempt to prove that I’ve met this goal by rewriting the bulk of Crank’s core logic as a series of additive commits, with explanations for what I’m doing at each step.</p>

And I know what you’re thinking: <em>oh no, not another web framework.</em> There are already so many of them out there and each carries a non-negligible cost in terms of learning it and building an ecosystem to surround it, so it makes sense that you would reject newcomers if only to avoid the deep sense of exhaustion which has come to be known amongst front-end developers as “JavaScript fatigue.” Therefore, this post is both an introduction to Crank as well as an apology: I’m sorry for creating yet another framework, and I hope that by explaining the circumstances which led me to do so, you will forgive me.</p>
