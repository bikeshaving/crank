Crank is written in TypeScript, and provides some types out of box so you can type-check your components and elements.

## Typing `this` in components
Trying to reference `this` in a component without a `this` type annotation will throw a type error in TypeScript‘s strict mode (you’ll see a message like `'this' implicitly has type 'any' because it does not have a type annotation`). Crank exports the `Context` class so you can annotate your components `this` as `Context`:

```tsx
import {Context} from "@bikeshaving/crank";
function *Timer (this: Context) {
  let seconds = 0;
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    seconds++;
    this.refresh();
  }, 1000);
  try {
    while (true) {
      yield <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
    }
  } finally {
    clearInterval(interval);
  }
}
```

## Typing the return types of components
You’ll often want to add a return type to your components. Crank exports custom types to help you type the return types of components:

```tsx
import {Element} from "@bikeshaving/crank";
function SyncFn(): Element {
  return <div>Hello world</div>;
}

function *SyncGen(): Generator<Element> {
  while (true) {
    yield <div>Hello world</div>;
  } 
}

async function AsyncFn(): Promise<Element> {
  return <div>Hello world</div>;
}

async function *AsyncGen(): AsyncGenerator<Element> {
  while (true) {
    yield <div>Hello world</div>;
  } 
}
```

`Element` is just the type returned by JSX expressions/`createElement`. As you can see, you still have to modify the return type of functions based on whether the function is async or a generator. You can also use the type `Child` which represents any valid value in an element tree.

```tsx
function *SyncGen(): Generator<Child> {
  yield true;
  yield false;
  yield null;
  yield undefined;
  yield 0;
  yield 9001;
  yield "Hello world";
  yield <div>Hello world</div>;
}
```

Anything assignable to `Child` can be part of the element tree, and almost anything can be assigned to `Child`.

## Typing props
You can type the props object passed to components. This allows JSX elements which use your component as a tag to be type-checked.

```tsx
function Greeting ({name}: {name: string}) {
  return (
    <div>Hello {name}</div>
  );
}

const el = <Greeting name="Brian" />; // compiles
const el1 = <Greeting name={1} />; // throws a type error
```

The children prop can be typed using the `Children` type provided by Crank. The `Children` type is a broad type which can be `Child` or arbitrarily nested iterables of `Child`. TypeScript doesn’t really provide a way to prevent functions from being used as the `children` prop, but such patterns are strongly discouraged. You should typically treat `children` as an opaque value only to be interpolated into JSX because its value can be almost anything.

```tsx
import {Children} from "@bikeshaving/crank";
function Greeting ({name, children}: {name: string, children: Children}) {
  return (
    <div>
      Message for {name}: {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Typing event listeners
If you dispatch custom events, you’re going to want parent event listeners to be typed with the event you bubbled automatically. To do so, you can extend a global `EventMap` type provided by Crank.

```tsx
declare global {
  module "@bikeshaving/crank" {
    interface EventMap {
      "mybutton.click": CustomEvent<{id: string}>;
    }
  }
}


function MyButton (props) {
  this.addEventListener("click", () => {
    this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("mybutton.click", {
      bubbles: true,
      detail: {id: props.id},
    }));
  });

  return (
    <button {...props} />
  );
}
```
