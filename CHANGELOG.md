# Changelog
## [0.3.0] - 2020-07-28
### Changed
- The context methods `get` and `set` are now named `provide` and `consume`.
- Changes to the internal renderer APIs in preparation for initial documentation.
  - Elements are passed in directly, rather than their tag and props.
  - The scope is now no longer passed to the patch method.
### Fixed
- Fixed errors not propagating from function component children.
- The context async iterator now suspends at its start if you yield before iterating over it (#137).
## [0.2.1] - 2020-07-02
### Fixed
- Fixed overloads of Context.prototype.set and Context.prototype.get not appearing in the d.ts file.
## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-01
### Changed
- Props are no longer rememebered between renders. For instance, rendering `<input checked />` and then `<input />` will not cause the checked prop to be deleted on the actual element.
- The internal Renderer API has been changed to use inheritance and away from the intrinsic generator API.
- `Renderer.prototype.render` and `Context.prototype.refresh` now return rendered values rather than undefined.
- The library is no longer transpiled.
- The esm directory in the package has been deleted. Refer to index, dom and html in the root of the package instead.
- Some types have been simplified
  - Tag no longer takes a type parameter.
  - The types `Props`, `FunctionComponent`, `GeneratorComponent`, `IntrinsicProps`, `ChildIterator`, `ChildGenerator` and `Key` have been removed from the public API.
### Added

- `crank-ref` props.
- `Context.prototype.schedule`.
- `Context.prototype.cleanup`.
- `Context.prototype.props`.
- `Context.prototype.value`.
- `dispatchEvent` now does bubbling and capturing correctly.
### Fixed
- Performance improvements in terms of execution time, runtime memory costs, and library size.
- Fixed `Context.prototype.dispatchEvent` not responding to `stopPropagation` and `stopImmediatePropagation`.
- Fixed nested SVG elements not rendering SVGElements in some cases.
- Improved error handling.

## [0.1.6] - 2020-05-25
- Backed out of a performance optimization where async generator components caused siblings to remain in the DOM.

- Fixed SVG attributes causing readonly errors (#119).
## [0.1.4] - 2020-05-17
### Fixed

- **basic performance improvements, you want to upgrade to at least 0.1.4 and probably 0.2 when it is released**
### Changed
- Got rid of the `HostContext` class in favor of exposing the HostNode directly to intrinsics.
- Added a way to pass information in a preorder traversal to child host nodes (search for Scoper/Scopes in the codebase).
- Added new flags for intrinsics to optimize performance (search for dirty in the codebase).

## [0.1.3] - 2020-05-05
### Fixed
- Made `event-target-shim` a direct dependency so TypeScript doesnâ€™t error (#95).
