# Changelog
## [0.5.0] - 2023-01-17

### Breaking changes
- The internal `RendererImpl` method `escape()` has been renamed to `text()`.
- The internal `RendererImpl` method `parse()` has been renamed to `raw()`, and the value is always passed to this method, regardless of if the value prop is a string.
- Generator components which return will now restart rather than stay stuck on the returned value. This should help when debugging components which have accidentally returned.

### Quality of life improvements
- Special props like `crank-key`, shortened to `c-key`, have an additional `$`-prefixed variant. Going forward, this will be the preferred syntax.
	```ts
	<div $key={key} $ref={ref} $static />
	```
- Generator components which are in a `for...of` or `for await...of` loop will now
attempt to exit the loop gracefully, so that cleanup code can go after the loop.
	```ts
	// before
	function Counter() {
		let i = 0;
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			i++;
			this.refresh();
		}, 1000);
		try {
			for ({} of this) {
				yield <div>{i}</div>;
			}
		} finally {
			clearInterval(interval);
		}
	}

	// after
	function Counter() {
		let i = 0;
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			i++;
			this.refresh();
		}, 1000);
		for ({} of this) {
			yield <div>{i}</div>;
		}
		clearInterval(interval);
	}
	```
- Async generator components can now use for...of loops. Async generator components which yield from a for...of loop will behave like sync generator components, pausing at each yield.
	```ts
	async function Counter() {
		let i = 0;
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			i++;
			this.refresh();
		}, 1000);
		for ({} of this) {
			yield <div>{i}</div>;
		}

		clearInterval(interval);
	}
	```

### New Features
- The automatic JSX runtime transform is now supported.
- Hydration: The DOM Renderer now provides a `hydrate()` method which will attempt to re-use DOM nodes already found on the page. A corresponding `hydrate()` method has been defined for custom renderers.
- Crank now provides a tagged template function called `jsx` which replicates JSX syntax and allows templates to be written with vanilla JavaScript.
- Calling `dispatchEvent()` on a component context will now trigger any `onevent` style props.

### Bug Fixes
- Errors which are thrown in Context event listener functions will not prevent other listeners from being called.
- Async generator components will now correctly re-run for latest props.
- IFrame/IMG `src` and other props which are sensitive to being re-assigned will not be re-assigned.
- $static elements which are re-rendered with different tags will now correctly re-render.

## [0.4.4] - 2022-08-08
### Fixed
- Inlined event listener methods to avoid errors caused by bundling (#238).
## [0.4.3] - 2022-06-25
### Fixed
- Fix readonly DOM properties not being set correctly (#231).
## [0.4.2] - 2021-12-20
### Fixed
- Fix null/undefined in className property for HTML renderer.
## [0.4.1] - 2021-10-29
### Added
- `createElement` and `Fragment` have been added to default module exports, to work with more JSX tools (#219).
### Fixed
- The HTMLRenderer will now correctly render `className` props (#221).
- Fixed a bug where `<Raw />` elements with parsed string values would lose their contents when rerendered (#224).
### Changed
- As part of #224, the internal `RendererImpl.parse()` method can now take any `ElementValue<TNode>` instead of `TNode`.
- The `./` export which was added in 0.4 was removed from package.json.
- The `main` and `module` fields will now point to crank.js.
## [0.4.0] - 2021-10-08
### Added
- Special props `crank-key`, `crank-ref`, `crank-static` now have shorthand equivalents `c-key`, `c-ref`, and `c-static` to save on typing.
- Crank is now published under the NPM package `@b9g/crank`, as well as the old `@bikeshaving/crank`. Again, this saves on typing.
- The `Context.prototype.flush()` method has been added. It behaves similarly to `Context.prototype.schedule()`, with the exception that it runs after a componentâ€™s children is in the DOM. This is important for things like focusing after render. See #180 for motivation.
- The `c-skip` (`crank-skip`) prop has been added as an alternative to `<Copy />` elements. See #173 for motivation and `src/__tests__/static.tsx` for examples.
### Changed
- I gave up and we now use `.cjs` files instead of `/cjs` directories for commonjs fallbacks.
- `innerHTML` now checks against the old prop value rather than reading from the DOM.
- Properties and styles which are missing from DOM element props will now be removed.
  Crank 0.3 tried to implement uncontrolled properties by saying missing props were uncontrolled. For instance, `<div class="class" />` rerendered as `<div />` would preserve the class property even though it was removed. Starting in 0.4, missing props and styles will be removed from DOM elements between renders.
- Crank will now log a console error when `undefined` is yielded or returned from a component. To squash these warnings, yield or return `null` instead.
- The default type for `TagProps` is now `Record<string, unknown>` as opposed to `unknown`.
- Crank will no longer attempt to reuse or modify elements. Motivated by #198.
- Internal context properties have been hidden using a symbol.
- The internal Renderer API has been overhauled yet again.
  - All internal methods which are implemented by the various renderers (`create()`, `patch()`, `arrange()`) have been removed from the base renderer class. Instead, you will now have to pass in these methods via a call to `super()` in the constructor. See `src/dom.ts` or `src/html.ts` for examples.
  - The `complete()` method has been renamed to `flush()`.
  - `patch()` now runs per prop as opposed to passing all props.
  - `patch()` now runs in a post-order call of the tree (yet again).
  - The signatures of all of the methods have been changed, mainly to avoid passing elements into the renderer, and allow for previous values to be inspected and used.
### Fixed
- Fixed some edge cases where event bubbling would result in `"Generator is already executing.
- Assigning to `boolean` properties with strings like `spellcheck="true"` will now work as expected. See #175 for motivation.
"` errors.

- `Renderer.prototype.render` and `Context.prototype.refresh` now return rendered values rather than undefined.

- Added a way to pass information in a preorder traversal to child host nodes (search for Scoper/Scopes in the codebase).
